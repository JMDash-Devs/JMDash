**Describe the missing information with source**
e.g. `con.out{}` Stands for 'console.output' used to output text and/or variables into the console. (e.g. `con.out{<< "Hello World!"};`) Source: [add source to the added info]

**Do you think that the information that's missing is crucial?**
e.g. A whole function is missing = Is crucial to the documentation
e.g. There's not a joke in this page = Isn't crucial to the documentation (even if jokes are important)
